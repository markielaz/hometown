# hometown

One of our early tasks at Northcoders was to build a site about our hometown, making use of Github to set up the project.

The majority of the course was focused on JavaScript, so this gave participants the opportunity to practice working with HTML & CSS.

It was important to make sure that the site was responsive, accessible and readible as well as looking attractive. It also needed to incorporate navigation to multiple pages across the site.

Because I already had experience with these concepts, I enjoyed this particular challenge.
